## Domain-Based Path Rewriting System

### System Overview

The domain-based path rewriting system enables intelligent request routing based on the incoming domain, allowing different domains to map to different backend paths or entirely different backend servers. This functionality is essential for multi-tenant applications, API versioning, and content organization.

### Path Rewriting Requirements

#### 1. Domain-to-Path Prefix Mapping

**Requirement**: The system must support mapping incoming domains to specific path prefixes on the backend server.

**Examples**:

- `ddt.com/page` → `allabout.network/ddt/page`
- `api.example.com/users` → `backend.com/api/users`
- `blog.site.com/posts/123` → `backend.com/blog/posts/123`
- `cdn.mysite.com/images/logo.png` → `backend.com/static/images/logo.png`

**Configuration Format**:

```bash
# Simple prefix mapping
DOMAIN_PATH_MAPPING=ddt.com:/ddt,api.example.com:/api,blog.site.com:/blog

# Complex routing rules (JSON format)
DOMAIN_ROUTING_RULES={"ddt.com": {"target": "allabout.network", "pathPrefix": "/ddt"}}
```

#### 2. Multiple Backend Support

**Requirement**: Different domains must be able to route to completely different backend servers.

**Examples**:

- `api.company.com` → `api-server.company.com`
- `static.company.com` → `cdn.company.com`
- `docs.company.com` → `documentation-server.company.com`

#### 3. Complex Pattern Matching

**Requirement**: Support for regex-based path transformations with pattern matching and substitution.

**Examples**:

- `api.v1.example.com/(.*)` → `backend.com/api/v1/$1`
- `([^.]+).api.example.com/(.*)` → `backend.com/tenants/$1/api/$2`
- `docs.example.com/v(\d+)/(.*)` → `backend.com/documentation/version-$1/$2`

#### 4. Fallback Mechanisms

**Requirement**: The system must provide graceful fallback when no routing rules match.

**Fallback Options**:

1. **Default Path Prefix**: Apply a default prefix when no rules match
2. **Pass-through**: Forward the original path unchanged
3. **Error Response**: Return a configured error response
4. **Redirect**: Redirect to a default domain/path

#### 5. Performance Requirements

**Requirement**: Path rewriting must add minimal latency to request processing.

**Performance Targets**:

- Path transformation: < 1ms per request
- Rule compilation: < 100ms at startup
- Memory usage: < 10MB for 1000 routing rules
- Cache efficiency: > 95% hit rate for compiled rules

### Technical Specification

#### 1. Path Rewriter Engine

**Component**: `path-rewriter.js`

**Responsibilities**:

- Parse and compile routing rules

- Manage fallback mechanisms
- Cache compiled rules for performance

**API Interface**:

```javascript
class PathRewriter {
  // Transform a request path based on domain
  transformPath(domain, originalPath, method = 'GET')
  
  // Get target backend for a domain
  getTargetBackend(domain)
  
  // Validate routing rules
  validateRules(rules)
  
  // Reload rules at runtime
  reloadRules(newRules)
}
```

#### 2. Domain Routing Configuration

**Configuration Schema**:

```javascript
{
  "domains": {
    "ddt.com": {
      "target": "allabout.network",
      "pathPrefix": "/ddt",
      "rules": [],
      "fallback": "prefix"
    },
    "api.example.com": {
      "target": "api-backend.example.com",
      "rules": [
        {
          "pattern": "/v1/(.*)",
          "replacement": "/api/v1/$1",
          "method": ["GET", "POST"]
        }
      ],
      "fallback": "passthrough"
    },
    "*.tenant.example.com": {
      "target": "multi-tenant-backend.com",

  "requestId": "req-123456"
}
```

## Cascading File Resolution System

### File Resolution Overview

The cascading file resolution system enables automatic file discovery and content transformation for extensionless requests. When a request is made for a path without a file extension, the system attempts to locate files with various extensions in a configurable priority order, then applies appropriate content transformations before serving the response.

### File Resolution Requirements

#### 1. Extensionless File Resolution

**Requirement**: The system must automatically resolve extensionless requests by checking for files with common extensions in priority order.

**Examples**:

- `/docs/readme` → checks for `/docs/readme.html`, `/docs/readme.md`, `/docs/readme.json`, etc.
- `/api/users` → checks for `/api/users.json`, `/api/users.csv`, `/api/users.txt`
- `/content/page` → checks for `/content/page.html`, `/content/page.md`

**Default Extension Priority**: `.html`, `.md`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.txt`, `.xml`

#### 2. HTTP HEAD Request Validation

**Requirement**: The system must use HTTP HEAD requests to verify file existence on target domains before attempting to fetch content.

**Implementation Details**:

- Non-intrusive file existence checking
- Minimal bandwidth usage for validation
- Circuit breaker protection for failing domains
- Configurable timeout and retry mechanisms

#### 3. Content Transformation Pipeline

**Requirement**: The system must transform content based on file type before serving to clients.

**Built-in Transformers**:

- **Markdown to HTML**: Convert `.md` files to HTML with proper styling
- **JSON Formatting**: Pretty-print JSON with syntax highlighting
- **CSV to HTML Table**: Convert CSV data to formatted HTML tables
- **XML Formatting**: Format XML with proper indentation and highlighting
- **Plain Text**: Serve text files with appropriate content-type headers

**Transformer Configuration**:

```javascript
{
  "transformers": {
    "markdown": {
      "enabled": true,
      "options": {
        "breaks": true,
        "linkify": true,
        "typographer": true
      }
    },
    "json": {
      "enabled": true,
      "options": {
        "indent": 2,
        "highlightSyntax": true
      }
    },
    "csv": {
      "enabled": true,
      "options": {
        "delimiter": ",",
        "headers": true,
        "tableClass": "csv-table"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Per-Domain Configuration

**Requirement**: File resolution settings must be configurable per domain to support different use cases.

**Configuration Examples**:

```bash
# Domain-specific extension priorities
FILE_RESOLUTION_EXTENSIONS_ddt_com=.html,.md,.json
FILE_RESOLUTION_EXTENSIONS_api_example_com=.json,.csv,.txt

# Domain-specific transformer settings
FILE_RESOLUTION_TRANSFORMERS_docs_site_com=markdown,json
FILE_RESOLUTION_TRANSFORMERS_api_site_com=json,csv
```

#### 5. Caching Strategy

**Requirement**: The system must cache both positive and negative file resolution results to optimize performance.

**Cache Types**:

- **Positive Cache**: Store successful file resolutions with content metadata
- **Negative Cache**: Store failed resolution attempts to avoid repeated checks
- **Transformer Cache**: Cache transformed content to avoid reprocessing

**Cache Configuration**:

```javascript
{
  "fileResolutionCache": {
    "positiveTTL": 3600,    // 1 hour for successful resolutions
    "negativeTTL": 300,     // 5 minutes for failed resolutions
    "transformerTTL": 7200, // 2 hours for transformed content
    "maxSize": 1000         // Maximum cache entries
  }
}
```

#### 6. Circuit Breaker Protection

**Requirement**: The system must protect against cascading failures when target domains become unavailable.

**Circuit Breaker Settings**:

- **Failure Threshold**: 5 consecutive failures
- **Recovery Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Half-Open Test**: Single request to test recovery
- **Success Threshold**: 3 consecutive successes to close circuit

## URL Transformation System

### URL Transformation Overview

The URL transformation system provides comprehensive URL masking capabilities by automatically detecting and rewriting all URLs in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS responses. This ensures that all URLs are routed through the proxy server, completely obscuring the original server's domain, IP address, and path structure from end users while maintaining full functionality and session state.

### URL Transformation Requirements

#### 1. Automatic URL Detection

**Requirement**: The system must automatically detect URLs in various content types and contexts.

**Supported Content Types**:

- HTML content (href, src, action, data-* attributes)
- JavaScript content (fetch calls, imports, location assignments, AJAX requests)
- CSS content (url() functions, @import statements, font sources)
- Inline styles and scripts within HTML

**Detection Patterns**:

- Absolute URLs: `https://example.com/path`
- Relative URLs: `/path/to/resource`, `../relative/path`
- Protocol-relative URLs: `//example.com/path`
- Fragment identifiers: `#section`
- Query parameters: `?param=value&other=data`

#### 2. URL Classification and Transformation

**Requirement**: The system must classify URLs and apply appropriate transformations based on their type and context.

**URL Types**:

- **External URLs**: Transform to route through proxy
- **Internal URLs**: Preserve relative structure while ensuring proxy routing
- **Fragment URLs**: Preserve functionality for single-page applications
- **Data URLs**: Pass through unchanged for embedded content
- **JavaScript URLs**: Handle special cases like `javascript:void(0)`

**Transformation Logic**:

```javascript
// Original URL in content
https://backend.example.com/api/users

// Transformed URL through proxy
https://proxy.domain.com/api/users
```

#### 3. Performance and Caching

**Requirement**: The system must provide optimal performance through intelligent caching and optimization.

**Caching Strategy**:

- **Pattern Cache**: Cache compiled regex patterns for URL detection
- **Transformation Cache**: Cache transformation results with LRU eviction
- **Content Cache**: Cache transformed content with configurable TTL
- **Negative Cache**: Cache failed transformation attempts

**Performance Targets**:

- URL detection: < 10ms for typical HTML pages
- Content transformation: < 100ms for pages up to 1MB
- Cache hit rate: > 90% for repeated content
- Memory usage: < 50MB for transformation cache

## Enhanced Cache Management System

### Cache Management Overview

The Advanced CDN application implements a comprehensive multi-tier cache management system that provides specialized caching for different types of operations, including response caching, URL transformation caching, and file resolution caching. The system includes advanced features such as nuclear cache clearing, detailed performance monitoring, and enhanced error handling.

### Core Cache Management Requirements

#### 1. Multi-Tier Cache Architecture

**Requirement**: The system must support multiple specialized cache types with independent management capabilities.

**Cache Types**:

- **Main Response Cache**: HTTP response caching with domain-aware keys
- **URL Transformation Cache**: Caching of URL transformation results for performance
- **File Resolution Cache**: Specialized caching for file resolution operations with dual TTL support

**Cache Isolation**:

- Each cache type must operate independently
- Cache failures in one type must not affect others
- Separate configuration and management for each cache type

#### 2. File Resolution Cache Management

**Requirement**: The system must provide specialized cache management for file resolution operations with dual TTL support for positive and negative results.

**API Endpoints**:

- `DELETE /api/cache/file-resolution` - Clear file resolution cache
- `GET /api/cache/file-resolution/stats` - Get file resolution cache statistics

**Features**:

- **Dual TTL System**: Different TTL for positive vs negative results
- **LRU Eviction**: Automatic cleanup when cache reaches capacity
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics for positive/negative hit rates
- **Memory Management**: Detailed memory usage tracking and optimization

#### 3. Nuclear Cache Clear System

**Requirement**: The system must provide system-wide cache clearing capabilities that coordinate across all cache types with comprehensive error handling and detailed feedback.

**API Endpoint**:

- `DELETE /api/cache/nuke` - Clear ALL caches system-wide

**Features**:

- **Multi-Cache Coordination**: Clears all cache types in a single operation
- **Error Isolation**: Individual cache failures don't prevent other caches from clearing
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operation logging for each cache type
- **Status Aggregation**: Multi-status response handling for partial failures

## Browser Issue Fixes (Completed)

The following critical browser issues have been resolved in the current version:

### Module System Compatibility Fix

**Issue**: Module system mismatch causing runtime errors and preventing proper metrics collection.

**Solution**: Converted ES modules to CommonJS for consistency across the codebase:

- `file-resolver.js` - Converted from ES modules to CommonJS
- `file-resolution-cache.js` - Converted from ES modules to CommonJS  
- `transformers/index.js` - Converted from ES modules to CommonJS

**Impact**: Eliminated `getStats is not a function` errors, improved server stability, and enabled reliable metrics collection.

### Gzip Decompression Error Handling

**Issue**: CDN failing to properly decompress gzipped content from upstream servers, causing corrupted JavaScript files and browser syntax errors.

**Solution**: Implemented robust error handling in `proxy-manager.js`:

- Enhanced decompression error handling with comprehensive logging
- Added fallback mechanisms for failed decompression
- Special protection for JavaScript files (returns 502 Bad Gateway instead of corrupted content)
- Improved content-encoding header management

**Impact**: Eliminated "Invalid or unexpected token" JavaScript syntax errors in browsers, improved content delivery reliability, and enhanced debugging capabilities.

### Content-Length Header Mismatch Fix

**Issue**: Node.js HTTP clients experiencing "Parse Error: Expected HTTP/" errors due to Content-Length header mismatches when serving decompressed gzip content.

**Root Cause**: When the proxy decompressed gzip content, the original Content-Length header (referring to compressed size) was sent with decompressed content, causing Node.js HTTP parser to expect more data than actually sent.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive header management in `proxy-manager.js`:

- Conditional Content-Length header exclusion in `setupResponseHeaders()` for compressed responses
- Proper Content-Length setting after decompression in `handleProxyResponse()`
- Fallback to chunked transfer encoding when Content-Length cannot be determined
- Comprehensive logging for debugging header flow

**Impact**: Eliminated HTTP parsing errors in Node.js clients while maintaining compatibility with curl and other HTTP clients. Both clients now receive identical, correctly formatted responses.

### Testing and Validation

**Integration Tests**: Created `test-fixes.js` to validate both fixes and prevent regression.

**Documentation**: Comprehensive fix documentation available in `docs/browser-issue-fixes.md`.
